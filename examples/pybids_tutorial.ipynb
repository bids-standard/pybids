You can use the `BIDSValidator` to determine whether a filepath is a valid BIDS filepath, as well as answering questions about what kind of data it represents. Note, however, that this implementation of the BIDS validator is *not* necessarily up-to-date with the JavaScript version available online. Moreover, the Python validator only tests individual files, and is currently unable to validate entire BIDS datasets. For that, you should use the [online BIDS validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/)."
